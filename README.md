I am introducing you to my wonderful profile on Github, which has been created due to wish for taking part in some
open source projects.
Main languages which I am using are: Python and previously CPP. I am most interested in software development, artificial intelligence. I write code using some popular libraries, for example Pytorch, Tensorflow.

I educate myself currently in the hot topics, as the chart right now is the artificial intelligence, I expand my skills in that field. The possibilities are enormous when describing the IT sector. That is why I try to endlessly educate myself in the current topics. The reason why computer science is important in my life, is the way by which I can go to automate my life and make it simpler. That is the main reason why I am passionate about it.

Most current topic which I am learning is Streamlit with Python.
